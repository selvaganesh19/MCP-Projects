# üöÄ MCP-Projects

Welcome to **MCP-Projects**! This repository is dedicated to integrating the MCP (Multi-Channel Platform) framework with various messaging platforms and tools. The primary focus is to facilitate seamless communication and automation across channels, starting with WhatsApp integration using [Claude AI](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) and MCP.

## üì¶ Introduction

**MCP-Projects** provides a flexible foundation for building messaging applications that interact with different platforms. For now, the core example is the WhatsApp integration, where messages are processed and responded to using the MCP server and Claude AI.

Whether you're looking to automate messaging workflows, build conversational bots, or experiment with cross-platform APIs, MCP-Projects gives you a starting point to extend and customize for your own needs.
